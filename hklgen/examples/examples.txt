Al2O3 - working
-----------------
Example Alumina data from BT1 with manually generated Linear-Spline background file

LFO - unknown
-----------------
Example LuFeMnO3 data from BT1 with manually generated Linear-Spline background file

LFO_20K - working
-----------------
Example LuFeMnO3 data from BT1 with manually generated Linear-Spline background file
Finds C1, but not C0

CeO2 - needs work
-----------------
FullProf Example
X-Ray data, need to add support for multiple wavelengths

HOBK - needs work
-----------------
FullProf Example
Magnetics behaving oddly. Mag-intensities are calculated but don't seem to show up in model.

lamn_3t2 - needs work
-----------------
FullProf Example
Fits atomic parameters, plus eta, base, scale, and zero correctly
Struggles when u,v,w and a, b, c added in

ncaf_3t2 - needs work
-----------------
FullProf Example
Fits atomic parameters, plus eta, base, scale, and zero correctly
Struggles when u,v,w and a, b, c added in

PbSO4 - working
-----------------
FullProf Example

prnio - needs work
-----------------
FullProf Example
Single crystal data. Partially implemented, but needs more work to plot and calculate sin(theta)/lambda vs F

ybacud1a - needs work
-----------------
FullProf Example
works when run normally, fit dies if a, b, and c are allowed to vary
